This package computes Wooldridge's test for 1st-order serial correlation
of residuals in panels.

The test is discussed in: Wooldridge, J.M. 2002. Econometric Analysis of Cross
Section and Panel Data. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, pp.282-283.

The null hypothesis is: no serial correlation of order one.

The function prints:
1) The results of the auxiliary regression for the model in first-differences;
2) The results of the regression of the estimated residuals in the previous
regression against its first lag;
3) The two-sided t-test (with the related p-value) for the null that the coefficient
attached to the lagged residuals is equal to -0.5.

The function returns a matrix with:
- the point estimate of the AR coefficient;
- the test statistic of the t-test;
- the p-value of the two-sided t-test.

The parameters of the function are:
y 		- series for the dependent variable
X 		- list of regressors
robustness_type	- integer (optional) selecting the standard error
(0=asymptotic, 1=HAC type Arellano (default), 2=HC type clustered Beck & Katz)
verbose		- integer (optional) for printing test output: 0=NO, 1=YES (default)

Please note that the the degrees of freedom for HAC and clustered standard errors
are equal to the number of cross-sectional units minus 1.

When comparing the results of this package with STATA's function "xtseria"
(see Drukker, D.M. 2003. Testing for serial correlation in linear panel-data
models, Stata Journal 3(2), 168-177) note that STATA conducts an F-type test
rather than a t-test.

Please also note that the results obtained with the sample data set provided
with xtserial in Stata are different from the results obtained in gretl with
the same data set. This is due to the fact that the data set includes a time
variable with breaks. Ex.: year 75, 77, 80, 81...
While Stata checks at the content of the variable and does not treat two time
periods as successive when they are actually not contiguous, gretl does not
run such a check. Therefore the two programs return different series for the
first-differenced variables.

NB: Since gretl version 2019d, this type of test is shipped natively with gretl.
However, the gretl version only supports HAC robust Arellano standard errors.

Changelog:
v2.1
- Add GUI access in the model menu for FE and RE panel models
- Add different methods to compute std. errors
- Switch from F-test to t-test version
- Add some santity checks
- Minor adaptions

V2.0
- Return value is now a matrix instead of a scalar
